-> Compile encroach and run it!
THINGS IMPLEMENTED / CHANGES TO ENCROACH
----------------------------------------
. VISUAL CHANGES
- rad intro screen woo. adding some plot/ motivation.
- added boundaries 
  - purely ascetic and because the lack thereof annoyed me
  - space invaders don't cross boundaries 
- changed minimum screen size
- some random ascetic tweaks all around i can't remember
. FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES
- encroachers can "return fire" semi-randomly 
  - not really randomly, because trying to create pseudo-random behavior with, like, the mod function alone was doomed to failure. 
  - at least it looks plausible!
- the player has three lives. 
  - countdown displayed in upper left corner
  - once player is hit by return fire three times, the game is over
- game over screen with option to replay or exit
